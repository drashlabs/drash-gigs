# Overview

An open source approach to creating opportunites (gigs, jobs and internships) and driving the gig-based economy and it's ecosystem in Kenya.

## But why?

The project idea came from [this community on WhatsApp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/FmRvzo5jpOzGAnfZRATqSb).

## The problem(s)

The main blockers noted during the inception and growth of the Community were:

1. A number of software developers who joined the [WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/FmRvzo5jpOzGAnfZRATqSb) were either in campus, fresh graduates, or looking for a gig/job/internship.
1. The skill-level of the techies in [the community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/FmRvzo5jpOzGAnfZRATqSb) would not be considered "job-ready".
1. More and more professions joined the community, creating a need for new, more focused, WhatsApp groups e.g. a group focused on [AI opportunities](https://chat.whatsapp.com/KLzvVjlGFIbDRjSYTNZizd).
1. Managing the content in the community became another hustler on it's own.

## The (proposed) solution

Well, the experience gained in running the community plus how rapid it was expanding brought about an opportunity:

1. For the developers, they can gain valuable experience by contributing to open source projects (like this one), making them "job-ready".
1. For the general community, a central, customized, experience, would open up a world of opportunities, not limited to what they are currently engaged in.

## Let's get technical
